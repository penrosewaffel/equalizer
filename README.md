This program performs a basic measurement of an audio feedback loop 
(speakers, microphone). It will output a file "equalizer.wav", that
serves as an equalizer when used as a "convolution filter", also
known as an FIR filter.

In this demonstration, the test signal is not symmetrical, so the 
filter will not be, either. This is not an error.
